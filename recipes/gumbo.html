    <h1>Gumbo Recipe</h1>
    <img src="../images/gumbo.jpg">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    Gumbo is a stew popular in the U.S. state of Louisiana, 
    and is the official state cuisine. Gumbo consists primarily of a
    strongly-flavored stock, meat or shellfish, a thickener, and the 
    Creole "holy trinity" ― celery, bell peppers, and onions. 
    Gumbo is often categorized by the type of thickener used, 
    whether okra or filé powder (dried and ground sassafras leaves).

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place chicken in a large pot; add enough water to cover. 
            Cover pot and bring to a boil; reduce heat to medium-low 
            and simmer until meat falls off the bone, about 90 minutes. 
            Remove chicken, let cool, and shred meat; skim broth and 
            reserve.        </li>
        <li> Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and 
            stir onions, bell pepper, and celery until tender, about 5 
            minutes. Stir in garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute.
             Add diced tomatoes, tomatoes with green chilies, andouille 
             sausage, okra, corn, salt, pepper, cayenne pepper, and reserved
              broth; bring to a gentle boil over medium-high heat. Simmer 
              until liquid is reduced by half, about 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Mix shredded chicken and shrimp into skillet; simmer 
            until shrimp turns bright pink and okra is tender, 5 to 
            7 minutes. Remove skillet from heat and stir in file powder.
             Serve with rice.  </li>
