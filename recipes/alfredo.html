    <h2>Description</h2>
    Fettuccine Alfredo or fettuccine al burro ("fettuccine with butter")
    is an Italian pasta dish of fresh fettuccine tossed with butter 
    and Parmesan cheese (Italian: pasta al burro e parmigiano).As the
     cheese melts, it emulsifies the liquids to form a smooth and 
     rich cheese sauce coating the pasta.The dish is named after 
     Alfredo di Lelio, who featured the dish at his restaurant in 
     Rome in the early to mid-20th century; the "ceremony" of 
     preparing it tableside was an integral part of the dish
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>10 ounces fettucini pasta</li>
        <li>0,5 cup butter </li>
        <li>5 cloves garlic, chopped</li>
        <li>1 cup heavy cream </li>
        <li>1 egg yolk</li>
        <li>2 cups freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons dried pasley</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add fettucine pasta and cook for 
            8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain </li>
        <li> In a large skillet melt the butter and add the chopped garlic. Cook on low for about
             5 minutes, stirring often, making sure not to burn the garlic.</li>
        <li>Pour about a 1/4 cup of the heavy cream into a small bowl. Add 
            the egg yolk and beat together; put aside. Pour the remaining 
            cream into the frying pan. Increase the heat to medium-high. 
            As the cream starts to boil, mix rapidly using a whisk. Slowly 
            add the cream/egg mixture. You do not want the egg to curdle. 
            Continue whisking until well blended.</li>
        <li>Add 1 cup of the Parmesan cheese and continue to mix the cream. 
            Pour in the remaining Parmesan and the parsley, mix until smooth. 
            Immediately remove from stove. Serve over cooked pasta. </li>
